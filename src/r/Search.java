 * Created by devinmcgloin on 6/6/15.
 * Controls TreeNodeHash and is present in R.
 * TODO: Consider the Following:
 * ------- BASIC SEARCH ----------
 * SEARCH FORM: "tree`leaves`green"
 * First word is the primary term.
 * Other words are secondary, with the 2nd having more weight than the third.
 *
 * Steps:
 * locate first node. in this case "tree"
 * Find distance of the 2nd term from "tree", remove nodes that are further than say 3 steps away.
 * Do the same for the third search and so on.
 * Always keep nodes that do not meet the all search terms, but push them to the end of the list.
 *
 * ------- SET SEARCH ----------
 * There will be situations in which a special search is needed, this is mostly for set logic.
 *
 * ------- KEY VAL SEARCH ----------
 * This type of search should only return key value pairs.
 * EG "How tall is the Empire State Building" etc etc ad infinitum.
