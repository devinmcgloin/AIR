##Outstanding Problems
- translating strings into their proper type and back again. Particularly important for ldata values.

##LDATA nodes
- just doing measurement and number for the time being.
- All LDATA nodes have ^expressions which verify that they have the proper attributes. 

##DB Scheme
- THings are stored as foot not ft or feet. This makes it easier to get the proper units etc.
